# Image-Forgery-Detection

## üìú **Description**

Image forgery detection is an essential task that aims to detect whether an image is
manipulated or not. There are various techniques that have been proposed to detect image
forgery, such as passive techniques, active techniques, and hybrid techniques. Passive
techniques rely on the analysis of the image's content, while active techniques involve the
use of watermarking, digital signatures, or other data embedding techniques. Hybrid
techniques combine both passive and active techniques to improve the accuracy of
detection. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have shown great potential in
detecting image forgery. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are two popular deep learning models that have been used
in image forgery detection. In this project, we propose to develop an image forgery
detection system using Python and Django web framework. The system will be designed
to detect whether an image is forged or not by analyzing its content. We will use deep
learning models such as CNNs and GANs to train the system to identify manipulated
images. The project will have the following main objectives: Develop a web-based user
interface for the image forgery detection system using Django web framework.
Implement various image forgery detection techniques, including passive, active, and
hybrid techniques. Explore the use of deep learning models such as CNNs and GANs in
detecting image forgery. Evaluate the performance of the image forgery detection system
using various metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. Develop a database for
storing the detected forged images and the relevant metadata. Implement data
visualization tools to analyze the performance of the system. The proposed system will
be useful in various applications such as journalism, social media, and legal evidence,
where the authenticity of images is crucial. The system will also be helpful in forensic
investigations, where the detection of manipulated images can aid in solving criminal
cases.
